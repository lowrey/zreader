# zreader
-----

Zreader is a speed reading webapp written in pure javascript. It functions by revealing the text before the reader at an adjustible speed, so the reader only sees text as fast as he can read it.  It also breaks texts into paragraphs and waits for user input before advancing to the next one. Zreader was designed with the idea of minimizing the amount of text a reader needs to see at any given time to reduce text overload.

A live demo is available at . It will read anything in the text area.  There are several different fonts that can be chosen as well as a numerical slider for the speed.  The code for the demo is available in this repository as index.html but the js libraries can be included easily in most any other site.
